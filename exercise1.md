# Python

## Linting / Testing / Building tools
I think in python the typical linting and testing tools are pylint and unittest. These are the ones that are familiar to me and that I've been taught and am used to. For testing I've also used pytest. For builds I've heard that tkinter is a good tool, but personally I am much more used to poetry.

## Alternatives for CI
From google seacthing I found GitLab, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, BuildKite among many others.

## Self hosted or cloud-based environment?
I can think of many advantages and disadvantages for both approaches. As said in the material a disadvantage of self hosted environments is that you must pay for the server yourself and if you're only using it for CI, you might be overpaying, whereas with a cloud-based environment you are only billed for your usage alone. It would be comforting, however, to know that your information was residing solely in your hands. A self hosted environment could perhaps also allow for some more complex pipelines. However a cloud-based environment would be easier to setup.
